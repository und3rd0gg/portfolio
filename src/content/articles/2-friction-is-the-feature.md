# friction is the feature
in a world where everything is free, nothing is valued.

scroll, like, forget.

read, nod, move on.

infinite content. zero weight.

but the moment you add friction, everything fucking thing changes.

i didn’t add a paywall to gatekeep. i added it to filter.

because when people pay, they pay attention.

they bring themselves to the table.

they read slower. think longer. feel more.

they invest, not just money, but meaning.

skin in the game isn’t about dollars.

it’s about care.
